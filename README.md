I've created an Autogluon classifier that can predict Monoceros stars using the provided dataset. The exciting part? We clinched the second spot in the competition! But beyond the ranking, what's really cool is that I've built a machine learning pipeline right from scratch.

This pipeline is a series of automated steps that handle everything from preparing the data, training the model, assessing how well it performs, to officially registering the model. It's like a one-stop-shop for machine learning. By setting up this pipeline, I aimed to make the whole process smoother and more efficient.

Feel free to dive into the code and documentation. They'll walk you through how to recreate what we've done here and how to adapt the pipeline for similar projects. Happy exploring!
